Procedure to extract behavioural response data and construct psychometric models, to support facial emotion EEG classification [NTU - Jul 2018]

Psychometric (sigmoidal) curves are fitted to identify the Point of Subjective Equality (PSE) where observing subject's response is split between the binary classes. 
Subjects were briefly presented with cued images of facial expressions, after which they need to respond whether they've just seen a Happy or Angry face. 
EEG signals were recorded during this decision-making process, for classification.
